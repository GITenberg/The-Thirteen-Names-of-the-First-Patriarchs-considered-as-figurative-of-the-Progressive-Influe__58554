<h2><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>A
SERMON.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">1 <span
class="smcap">Chron</span>.&nbsp; 1st Chap.&nbsp; 4 first
Verses.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Adam</i>, <i>Seth</i>,
<i>Enosh</i>, <i>Kenan</i>, <i>Mahalaleel</i>, <i>Jared</i>,
<i>Methuselah</i>, <i>Henoch</i>, <i>Noah</i>, <i>Shem</i>,
<i>Ham</i>, &amp; <i>Japheth</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">All</span> Scripture is given by
inspiration of God, (says the great Apostle) and is profitable
for <i>doctrine</i>&mdash;to declare and confirm the
truth&mdash;for <i>reproof</i>&mdash;to convince men of sin and
confute errors&mdash;for <i>correction</i>&mdash;to reform the
life, upon conviction&mdash;and for <i>instruction in
righteousness</i>, in the obedience of God our Saviour, as the
only justifying righteousness of his Church.&nbsp; Every part of
the sacred writings has an importance, a dignity, and a
spirituality, becoming their divine author&mdash;and they are
designed by God the Holy Ghost, to exhibit the glorious character
of God our Father, as engaged in a covenant of redemption with
his dear Son&mdash;Likewise, to hold forth the precious Person
and finished work of God our Redeemer, as the only foundation and
joy of poor guilty men, convinced <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>of sin, and seeking his
salvation.&nbsp; They likewise maintain the nature and necessity
of a divine change, through the operation of God the Spirit upon
the souls of his elect, to make known to them the suitableness of
Jesus and his salvation; to persuade the mind of its interest in
him; and to witness to their renewed consciences they belong to
God.&mdash;These, with many other grand truths, are everywhere
set forth in God&rsquo;s most holy word; sometimes in very plain
and clear language, so that he who runs may read; at other times
the same truths are couched in Parables, Allegories, and dark
Sayings: this shews what a pleasing variety there is in
God&rsquo;s most holy word, to entertain an enlightened
mind.&nbsp; As God, our Covenant Father, has made nothing in
vain, so he has revealed nothing in vain; his peculiar wisdom is
seen even in giving names, or causing such and such names to be
given to various characters, either in allusion to some
circumstance attending their birth, or prophetical of what they
were to be&mdash;or, as holding forth something of importance,
either to themselves or to others.</p>
<p>It is not from a desire of singularity, nor an affectation of
novelty, that I have read this text; but would proceed with
caution and humility.</p>
<p>I apprehend the first design of the text is to point out the
<i>Genealogies</i> of the tribes of Israel, and is supposed to
have been wrote by Ezra, and put into <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>their hands, soon after the return
from Babylon, as the captivity for seventy years, had thrown
every thing in confusion.&mdash;The second design is to shew the
<i>Pedigree</i> of the Messiah, that it might appear that our
dear Lord was, according to the prophecies that went before him,
the <i>Son of David</i>, the <i>Son of Joseph</i>, the <i>Son of
Adam</i>&mdash;this the Evangelists, in the New Testament, have
shewn.&nbsp; There still appears one more worthy our observation;
that the <i>first thirteen Names</i> in this Chapter have a
signification in them, as they are Hebrew Names, and appear to be
expressive of a Work of Grace in its commencement, carrying on,
and completion, in the happy departure of the soul to
glory.&nbsp; I pretend to no learning myself, of course must be
indebted to Hebrew scholars for the translation of them&mdash;to
God the divine Spirit, I am entirely indebted for the knowledge
of the great things these Names express.&nbsp; On each I shall
write but little, as it would swell this Sermon to a volume if I
were to write all that I apprehend; I will only give the
out-lines, and hope the reader will be entertained, and, above
all, instructed, comforted, and built up on his most holy
faith.</p>
<p>The Names, as they stand before us, are thus in their
signification: Adam, <i>Earth</i>&mdash;Seth,
<i>Foundation</i>&mdash;Enosh, <i>Weakness</i>&mdash;Kenan,
<i>Mourning</i>&mdash;Mahalaleel, <i>Illumination of
God</i>&mdash;Jared, <i>Reigning</i>&mdash;Enoch,
<i>dedicated</i>&mdash;Methuselah, <i>sending forth
Death</i>.&mdash;Lamech, <i>cutting down</i>&mdash;Noah,
<i>Rest</i>, or <i>Consolation</i>&mdash;<a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span><i>Shem</i>, a
Name&mdash;Ham, <i>Warmth</i>&mdash;Japheth,
<i>Enlargement</i>.&nbsp; There is a beautiful gradation in them,
and we shall consider them in order, and enlarge particularly on
some.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Adam</span>.&nbsp; This word signifies
<i>Earth</i>; some read it <i>red Earth</i>, to shew our
original&mdash;formed of the dust of the earth, and in
consequence of sin, to dust we must return!&nbsp; This is an
humbling thought to proud mortals.&nbsp; Adam was a striking
figure of our blessed Jesus, in many instances; at present we
only view him in his origin.&nbsp; God displayed his sovereignty
in creating man, and setting him up as the head of all
mankind.&nbsp; He viewed him as the figure in which our blessed
Jesus should hereafter appear.&nbsp; He viewed all the elect in
him, ordained the fall through him, for the grand purpose of
displaying the riches of his grace, and the exaltation of our
nature, through its union to Jesus: so the elect, as fallen in
Adam, and actual transgressors, are become earthly, sensual, and
devilish!&nbsp; Almighty grace appears, in its sovereignty,
passing by fallen angels, and raising such earthly creatures as
we are!&nbsp; Here, believer, admire and adore the God who loved
your nature so well as to chuse it, and redeem it, and
afterwards, by the gracious inhabitation of God the Spirit, to
make it his holy, living temple.&mdash;This leads me to notice
the name</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Seth</span>.&nbsp; This word is rendered
by some <i>put</i>&mdash;<a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>by others, <i>appointed</i>&mdash;by
others it signifies <i>foundation</i>.&nbsp; Consider the word in
either sense it still seems expressive that God&rsquo;s elect,
though fallen in Adam, are <i>put</i>, or <i>appointed</i> to be
partakers of covenant grace in their hearts.&nbsp; God would lay
a foundation in the divine operations of the Spirit, for every
good word and work; the new man is the foundation of every good
desire&mdash;this new man is formed at once; it is not done by
piece-meal, but it is done the moment the divine Spirit takes up
his abode in the soul; the train of graces always follows the
blessed Spirit of all grace, in the temples of the souls of his
elect; his train fills the temple.&nbsp; This new man is the
image of Christ; this is that which is <i>born of God</i>, <i>and
sinneth not</i>, <i>neither can it commit sin</i>&mdash;it is
Spirit, it is the kingdom of God within us, that does not come by
observation, it chiefly consists in light, life, and love: and
this new man, though often hid from its possessor, and always
opposed, from a body of sin and death, yet it shall reign,
through righteousness, to everlasting life&mdash;a troop may
overcome, but <i>it</i> shall overcome at last.&mdash;We shall
now trace it in its various operations and blessed effects; this
leads us to the Name of</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enos</span>, signifying
<i>Weakness</i>.&nbsp; This is one of the sad effects of the
Fall; but an experimental acquaintance with it is an evidence of
grace&mdash;a branch of that knowledge God has promised to give
his <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>people&mdash;<i>all thy children shall be taught of
God</i>.&nbsp; Our blessed Jesus is revealed in the Word as the
strength of his saints; and has promised we shall say for
ourselves, <i>in the Lord have I righteousness and
strength</i>&mdash;this can be of no use to a sinner till he is
first convinced of his criminality and weakness; we learn the
former much sooner than the latter&mdash;we soon find our
criminality, and feel wretched in consequence, but we do not soon
learn our strength is perfect weakness.&nbsp; We soon believe we
have violated the Law, but we are some time learning to cease
from our vain labour and rest alone in Jesus; to work we
generally go, with all our might, quite forgetting that it is
written, <i>to him that worketh not</i>, <i>but believeth</i>,
<i>is the reward reckoned</i>.&nbsp; We strive to keep the Law; I
can truly say I did: I began first with the fourth commandment;
then I vowed to set a watch over my thoughts, but, alas! I found
Sin and Satan too strong for me: in the next place I saw the law
was <i>spiritual</i>, and cursed me for every sinful thought!
this threw down my Babel building.&nbsp; I strove to pacify my
conscience with many prayers, and to please God with vows; to
conquer sin by my own arm; by watchfulness, by reading more
prayers, performing my duty with greater diligence.&nbsp; I read
the Whole Duty of Man; on my knees I said over all the prayers in
it&mdash;still sin overturned the whole of my performances; God
still appeared angry; the Law cursed me, and the fears of death,
the prospect of future judgment, and <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>the horrid idea of standing at the
bar of God, overcame me, till I wished I never had been
born.&nbsp; I can truly say that I envied the brute creation;
begged of God to annihilate me; my heart rose in awful rebellion
against him in all his dealing.&nbsp; Often have I said, in the
language of Dr. <i>Watts&rsquo;s</i> Songs for Children,</p>
<blockquote><p>And must the crimes that I have done<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be read and publish&rsquo;d there;<br />
Be all expos&rsquo;d before the Sun,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While men and angels hear!</p>
<p>Lord! at thy feet asham&rsquo;d I lie&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upward I dare not look;<br />
Pardon my sins before I die,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And blot them from thy book.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words exactly suited my case; in these things I have,
and do feel my native weakness&mdash;in keeping the Law, in
pleasing God with human performances, in pacifying conscience
with mere vows, in conquering sin, in my own strength, and in
keeping up my own animal spirits, under desertion, darkness,
guilt, and trouble.&nbsp; O! what a mercy it is to have a
burden-bearer! if it was not for this I must sink! and what a
privilege to be taught how to cast our burthen on him who careth
for us.&nbsp; Under the conviction of our native weakness, the
character of Jesus, as the strength of our hearts, is exceeding
precious; while we daily learn by constant experience, <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>that as
fallen sinners we are weak as we are wicked; the blessed Spirit
convincing us of this, always produces the next name,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kenan</span>, <i>Mourning</i>.&nbsp; This
generally stands connected with deep-rooted spiritual convictions
of our state, as fallen, depraved, guilty, and helpless.&nbsp; We
mourn on various accounts; sometimes because of our depravity,
our guilt, and weakness; that do what we can, we are no
better&mdash;still God is angry with us; the rebellion we feel,
which must be God-provoking.&nbsp; We are grieved we ever sinned
against him, because it has exposed us to his wrath.&nbsp; All
this mourning comes from a legal spirit; but there is a godly
mourning, or a mourning after God&mdash;this comes from every
sweet view we have of Jesus, as held forth in the Gospel; as the
Saviour, Surety, Righteousness, and atoning Sacrifice&mdash;the
soul is following after him&mdash;we want the happy enjoyment of
him in our souls.&nbsp; With pleasure we listen to the Gospel,
which exhibits his charms; the soul is filled with longing
desires after him&mdash;a moving in the mind towards him&mdash;a
venturing near to him&mdash;a longing for the day of his
espousals&mdash;to read its part and lot in him.&nbsp; I am sure
that the above was my case; I ran to the house of God, in hopes
that every sermon I was going to hear, would be the time, and O
how grieved was I when I had to return, and my beloved had not
appeared in the way and manner I expected him.&nbsp; I find
through all <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>my pilgrimage, that the Lord always works in his own
time and way.&nbsp; This, however, was mourning after him; this
is certainly some small proof of love.&nbsp; Sometimes I longed
to see my part and lot in him, from a principle of fear;
sometimes from a principle of love, the going out of affection to
him; hearing so much of him, and having an inward spiritual
perception of his suitableness and glory.&nbsp; Two passages of
scripture often did me good; the one says, <i>By faith Noah was
moved with fear</i>, <i>prepared himself an Ark</i>: the other
says, <i>Whom having not seen we love</i>; <i>and though now we
see him not</i>, <i>yet</i>, <i>believing</i>, <i>we
rejoice</i>.&mdash;But as I must be brief, I will mention the
next Patriarch&rsquo;s name,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mahalaleel</span>.&nbsp; This signifies
the <i>Descending</i>, or the <i>Illumination of
God</i>&mdash;and follows the other name with great
propriety.&nbsp; It is written, <i>Seek</i>, <i>and ye shall
find</i>; <i>knock</i>, <i>and it shall be opened to you</i>; you
shall find Christ the pearl of great price.&mdash;While the
prison doors of unbelief and sin, horrors and gloomy fears are
opened, the Lord Jesus descends to those who look for him, wait
for him and expect him, for there shall be a reward, and thine
expectation shall not be cut off; the blessed Spirit that has
once operated upon the mind, as a reprover, convincer, and
begotten the soul to an hope, will answer to his lovely
character, the <i>Comforter</i>.&nbsp; If he communicates life to
feel after God, to desire Christ above all, to keep up a constant
hoping-for <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>a smile from God, he will never, no, never disappoint
it.&nbsp; Take courage, then, ye fearing characters, look to
<i>his</i> word and faithfulness, who has said, <i>Shall I bring
to the birth</i>, <i>and not cause to bring forth</i>?&nbsp;
<i>He is faithful that promised</i>, <i>who also will perform
it</i>&mdash;<i>If we believe not</i>, <i>he abideth
faithful</i>, <i>he cannot deny himself</i>, nor of course his
people, who are part of himself.&nbsp; This kept up my mind in
looking for a deliverance.&nbsp; Sometimes I vowed I would give
it up altogether, but God would not, did not give me up.&nbsp;
Sometimes my heart fainted within me, lest I should never see the
Lord in the land of the living, especially after waiting long,
and praying much.&nbsp; I well understood that text in the
Proverbs, <i>Hope deferred makes the heart</i> (full of
expectation) <i>sick</i>.&nbsp; When I could get out to hear the
Word, I ran to Providence Chapel; heard the Word greedily, and
kept watching for something that might be said, as a voice to me,
or some sweet sight of a smiling God; but I returned again and
again, sadly disappointed; and being under a legal spirit, began
to quarrel with myself, and said, Ah! God has not appeared
propitious yet, because I am such a sinner: Oh, if I was more
diligent, more watchful and less sinful, then, indeed, I might
rest assured he would shew my sins forgiven, and smile upon
me.&nbsp; Thus I wanted, fool-like, to take a price in my hand,
to set wisdom.&nbsp; Sometimes my rebellious heart would quarrel
with God himself; when I had been remarkably devout, then my
expectations <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>were great, and I was still disappointed; so that I have
often been led to see that God acts from no motive, but in
himself; all his operations of providence and grace, are to
display his sovereignty&mdash;it is not of him that willeth, nor
him that runneth, for I did both; all must be solved here,
<i>Even so Father</i>, <i>it seemeth good in thy sight</i>.&nbsp;
Not but we are still to be found in the use of means, for he
purposed from everlasting to save his people; he promised the
same in his word; all is made sure to us; yet he will be enquired
of to do these things for his people.&nbsp; However, we are to
subscribe with the hand, to the God of Jacob, or, in New
Testament language, <i>to set to our seal he is true</i>.&nbsp;
This work, or spiritual building, must go on; <i>I will work and
who shall let it</i>?&nbsp; God begins it with a view to carry it
on, and who can frustrate the designs of Jehovah to Sion&rsquo;s
mourners?&nbsp; To Sinners, weak, worthless, and mourning, God
has sent his dear Son: here is God descending, and the Holy
Spirit bearing an internal clear testimony to the soul, <i>that
it is born of God</i>; leading us to see him, and sweetly
persuading the soul to say, <i>Father</i>!&mdash;while he shines
into the heart, and gives us the light of the knowledge of his
glory.&nbsp; This is illumination indeed!&nbsp; His glory is seen
in pardoning sin, displaying his free grace, and exalting a
precious Jesus!&nbsp; The knowledge of this we get under the
Word, but the light of the knowledge is the clear shining of it
in our own personal experience; by the witness of the
Spirit&mdash;an <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>holy joy in God&mdash;solid peace in the
conscience&mdash;access to the throne of God&mdash;a full
persuasion of our interest in the love and covenant God of our
salvation: this is scriptural, experimental, heart-felt religion;
this is God descending, and such appearances are always attended
with divine illumination&mdash;in his light we see light; in his
light we saw darkness before&mdash;now we see God as our God; and
God is light&mdash;we see Jesus, and can exclaim, <i>The Lord is
my light</i>.&mdash;All this is manifested to us by the
teachings, the clear persuasions of God the Spirit; thus we see
the religion that comes from God always leads to God again.&nbsp;
The light of the hypocrite makes him proud, puffs him up; but
this leads us out of self, to admire, enjoy, and adore the
glorious undivided Trinity in Unity, the center of our happiness,
the source of our joy: this is the nature of true joy in the
Lord, whether experienced at our first conversion, or in all our
after renewings&mdash;all joy which does not center in God, will
go out; it is the lamp of the foolish Virgins, that will
expire.&nbsp; On this part of the subject I would say a few words
on the way the Lord led me.&nbsp; It must ever be remembered by
us, that the Holy Spirit is a Sovereign in all his dispensaries;
so his sovereignty is particularly discerned in the manner of his
operations upon his people&mdash;the way in which they are
called&mdash;the more gentle leadings, and the awful storms that
others experience; with the manner of introducing the soul into
the liberty of the sons of God, appears <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>to manifest
that the Almighty Minister in the Church does as he
please&mdash;<i>for there are diversities of operations</i>,
<i>but it is the same Spirit</i>.&mdash;I find the Work of the
Spirit is the same in its nature and tendency, on all God&rsquo;s
elect.&nbsp; But there is a material difference in the way in
which this Work is begun and carried on: Paul and Lydia were in
possessions of this Work, yet the way they were brought into it
was very different&mdash;the grand end was answered, namely, in
bringing them to Jesus.&nbsp; This is the covenant Work of the
Spirit upon all&mdash;many are driven by fearful horrors; others
are led on very gradually&mdash;I must confess the latter was my
case, yet I have often wished it had been the former, because,
then I think the deliverance would have been the more
conspicuous; but my convictions were gentle, and my deliverance
was gradual; not that I was without fears, horrors, or terrible
ideas&mdash;I saw God was angry with me for sin; I tried to
please him, but in vain&mdash;the Law came home to my heart, and
much bondage, legal striving, and awful rebellion did I feel; the
fears of death and dread of hell I was seldom free from for years
together.&nbsp; I have often thought my case was very
singular.&nbsp; It is said in the Book of Psalms, <i>The entrance
of thy Word givith Light</i>.&nbsp; Now I know the first time I
ever felt or saw the light, was at the age of fifteen.&nbsp;
Being naturally an enemy to God&rsquo;s Saints, Word, and
Ministers, and living in an enemy&rsquo;s house, that enmity,
through native blindness, <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>was increased.&nbsp; Being
apprenticed in the neighbourhood of Providence Chapel, I heard
much of, and joined in the ridicule against Mr.
<i>Huntington</i>.&nbsp; One evening going of an errand, the
Chapel being opened, I thought I would go in to hear what the
babbler had to say, that I might have a little sport the next
day.&nbsp; As soon as the text was read, the words came home to
my mind in such a way as I cannot describe, only by the idea of a
candle brought a light into a dark room!&nbsp; This overcame me,
melted my heart, and I went out of the Chapel a few minutes
after.&nbsp; From that moment I was led to feel my need of a
Saviour.&nbsp; This light was attended afterwards with love, with
desire, hopes, and a turning my feet to God&rsquo;s
testimonies.&nbsp; I loved the people, minister, and word I
before hated&mdash;I now saw with new eyes; I had many
convictions before, but no desires after an interest in the
Saviour&mdash;they were doubtless from God, though they were
legal, but from this period I believe they were spiritual.&nbsp;
My mind was set to seek the Lord&mdash;great pleasure I found in
the ways of the Lord.&nbsp; I now had clearer convictions than
ever of my ruined state, and they were attended with eager
desires after a sense of my part and lot in Christ.&nbsp;
Sometimes I thought I should be favored with it&mdash;othertimes
not.&nbsp; The next very clear entrance of light was more
visionary on the mind&mdash;I was hearing a minister on the
Sufferings of Christ but felt an unusual indifference to all that
he said.&nbsp; When the <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Sermon was ended the grand Hymn was
gave out,</p>
<blockquote><p>When I survey the wond&rsquo;rous cross,<br />
On which the Prince of Glory died&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was attended in a moment with such an affecting view of
the Sufferings of Jesus as is impossible to describe: I saw him
clearly on the Cross, in great agonies&mdash;this deeply affected
me&mdash;I covered my face lest any one should see my
tears.&nbsp; This was followed with a thought that every sin of
mine &ldquo;did cost his heart a groan!&rdquo;&mdash;The Lord now
led me on to seek him more than ever, and to know that he
actually died for me; for the above vision was only on the mind;
it did not shine into the heart with any assurance, therefore I
could not rest on it.&nbsp; I told a good woman of it who
attended Providence Chapel, and she assured me it was a token
from the Lord, that I should be brought into glorious liberty,
and, perhaps, preach a crucified Christ: Though this at the time
appeared very unlikely, yet so it came to pass.</p>
<p>The next clear light manifested to my mind in a sensible way,
was in hearing Mr. H. on&mdash;<i>Go forth</i>, <i>O ye daughters
of Zion</i>, <i>and behold King Solomon</i>.&nbsp; This was
sweet, clear, and precious indeed.&nbsp; Under that Sermon I had
very blessed discoveries of Jesus, in the Suitableness of his
Person, and the Love of his Heart, yet could not say he was
mine.&nbsp; The <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>Lord the Spirit continued my teacher, and many
encouraging seasons I experienced.&nbsp; Sometimes full of doubts
and fears&mdash;shut up in unbelief&mdash;overcome at times with
besetting sin, which brought on all my horrors again; and while
expecting to be cut off and sent to hell, was, on the contrary,
many a time melted with his forbearing and tender
mercy.&mdash;Thus I was kept, hoping and depending, looking for a
deliverance and often disappointed.&nbsp; These words of Mr.
<i>Toplady</i>, the first time I saw them, was very sweet to me,
at a time when I was particularly low;</p>
<blockquote><p>Yet, Lord, if thou ne&rsquo;er had&rsquo;st
design&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No covenant blessing for me;<br />
Ah, tell me how is it I find<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such sweetness in waiting for thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For I often found it blessed to be waiting upon, and waiting
for God.&nbsp; I often envied the felicity of those who could
say, <i>My God</i>.&mdash;When I was a little indisposed in body
I was much afraid I should die in the pit&mdash;this made me in a
hurry to get out of it.&nbsp; I think such a state is described
by <i>Isaiah</i>&mdash;<i>The captive exile hasteneth that he may
be loosed</i>, <i>lest he should die in the pit</i>, <i>and that
his bread should fail</i>.&nbsp; Here such a case is exactly set
forth; and fast held we are&mdash;I felt it so&mdash;held by the
chains of sin, the iron bars of unbelief, the curses of the Law,
the fears of death, and the dread of future judgement.&nbsp;
Sometimes I got very cold and <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>indifferent about it&mdash;then that
text would make me tremble&mdash;<i>Ephraim is joined to
idols</i>; <i>let him alone</i>!&nbsp; This made me chuse my
burden, for I was always afraid of ease, or losing my burden I
knew not how.&nbsp; Sometimes I got sweetly refreshed under the
word; then my hope was busy, expecting greater things than
those&mdash;at other times I got cut up, root and branch; this
made me go away, groaning in spirit, yet obliged to go to the
same place where I had been wounded, and there God generally
healed me.&nbsp; I felt great liberty at times, in reading some
of Mr. <i>Huntington&rsquo;s</i> Works, namely, the Letters to
the late tried Mr. <i>Jenkins</i>&mdash;one Passage especially,
which is rather too long to transcribe, was particularly blessed
to me, in the first volume of the &ldquo;Living
Testimonies,&rdquo; page 61&mdash;the latter part of the Sermons
on &ldquo;The Dimensions of Eternal Love,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Law established by Faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; These were marrow and
fatness to my soul; but after waiting, seeking, longing,
desiring, fearing, desponding, and praying, the Lord descended to
give me a clearer illumination of mind&mdash;it shone into my
heart, lifted me up with joy, overcame me with love, made me cry,
my Father! my God! my Beloved! my Portion! my All!&mdash;I
wondered, I rejoiced, I wept, I was completely absorbed in love,
wonder, and joy.&nbsp; One Day at work, thinking over my state,
and inwardly fretting in my heart, the Lord suddenly whispered,
with peculiar power, and clothed it with much light&mdash;<i>the
Son of Man is come to save that </i><a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span><i>which was lost</i>!&nbsp; There
was such a peculiar emphasis upon the word, that I stood still; I
was, for a few moments, quite confused, but presently I felt a
sweet sensation of gratitude, love, and joy.&nbsp; I was enabled
to see my sins were forgiven, my soul justified in Christ, God
well pleased with me, and a throne of grace open to me.&nbsp; I
humbly conceive this was the <i>Joy</i> of Faith, God had blest
me with the <i>Grace</i> of it before&mdash;now I had the
<i>Joy</i> of it&mdash;I was happy in Christ.&nbsp; This pleasure
of mind gradually abated.&nbsp; On the following Sunday morning I
went, as usual, to Providence Chapel.&nbsp; Mr. <i>Huntington</i>
preached on, <i>Cast out the bond-woman and her son</i>.&nbsp;
When the text was read I thought there would be nothing for
me&mdash;but O! the sweet surprize! God spoke almost every word
of the Sermon to me.&nbsp; The preacher was led to describe
bondage and liberty; the latter he shewed was gradual&mdash;in
some cases sudden; in short, it was the making my <i>new
birth</i> clear to me; nor have I had the fears of death and
dread of hell, in that legal, horrid manner, come upon me ever
since.&nbsp; Thus the light came&mdash;light of the knowledge of
his glory.&nbsp; This has been often renewed to me since, but
never in so glorious a manner&mdash;God has led my faith often to
make use of the same precious truth that was so directly applied
to my heart.&nbsp; This experience is described by
<i>John</i>&mdash;<i>perfect love casteth out fear</i>&mdash;this
love leads up the mind to Jesus; and it being attended with sweet
views of him in his <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>offices, and those offices exercised in our
hearts&mdash;his prophetic office, in the teachings of his word
and Spirit; his priestly office, in the application of pardon; we
are made his willing subjects, while he reigns king in our
affections.&mdash;This leads to the name</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jered</span>, which signifies
<i>Reigning</i>.&nbsp; Christ&rsquo;s spiritual reign in the
soul; his reign in the Church, as his holy hill; and our reigning
with him.&nbsp; Much is said in Scripture about the Saints&rsquo;
reign&mdash;hence they are called Kings; Christ reigns in them;
their hearts are his throne for ever&mdash;as Christ reigns in
their hearts so do they in his, and they shall overcome and sit
down with him in his throne.&nbsp; This is accomplished in some
degree, in a time state, when we are led to the Atonement, and
Faith receives it; all the while we enjoy the blessing of it we
shout victory through his blood.&nbsp; Faith in Jesus overcomes
the world, the fears of death, and our own inbred
corruptions&mdash;<i>they overcame by the blood of the
Lamb</i>&mdash;and being favored with victory, we are
crowned&mdash;we take our rest in the love of God; this is the
throne on which we sit, and shall reign for ever&mdash;we shall
likewise reign in the new heaven and earth a thousand
years&mdash;<i>Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the
earth</i>&mdash;we shall reign on the earth; <i>and they lived
and reigned with Christ a thousand years</i>; this last reign is
as sure to us as we are crowned conquerors now.&nbsp; As Christ
<a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>lives in
us and reigns king in our affections, so he gives us grace to
swear eternal allegiance to him.&nbsp; Thus we are led to the
next name,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enoch</span>, <i>dedicated</i>.&nbsp; Our
souls and bodies are his, by the eternal gift of the
Father&mdash;<i>he purchased the Church with his own
blood</i>&mdash;and having conquered our hearts with his love, we
are his willing subjects&mdash;made willing to be, to do, and
suffer any thing and every thing he calls us to, and gives us
grace for.&nbsp; We wish him to have the whole heart, without a
rival&mdash;our time and talents we would give to him, who has
done such great things for us; not that we must for a moment,
think we can do any thing for God, no; he must work all in us,
and do all for us; and by all-powerful grace keep us in the good
ways of God.&nbsp; This operation of light, and reign of love, is
always attended with a devotedness of spirit to God; hence the
Apostle says, <i>None of us should live to himself</i>, <i>but to
God</i>&mdash;and again, <i>I beseech you</i>, <i>brethren</i>,
<i>by the mercies you have received</i>, <i>that you present
yourselves a living sacrifice</i>, <i>holy and acceptable unto
God</i>, <i>which is your reasonable service</i>.&nbsp; The
Apostle here addresses converted men, who have received Christ,
the mercy promised, and all blessings in him.&nbsp; These
blessings are communicated to the soul, and manifested in the
exercises of faith and love.&nbsp; <i>Life</i>&mdash;this makes
us a <i>living</i>&mdash;a <i>new nature</i>&mdash;this makes us
a <i>holy</i>, sacrifice.&nbsp; It is our desire <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>to be the
Lord&rsquo;s for ever; to enjoy him in all, to see him in all, to
be dependent on him, and to praise him for all, in life, death,
and eternity; while, as it respects the Church and the World, we
wish to walk as he walked; this is summed up in that striking
passage&mdash;<i>that we</i>, <i>being delivered from our
enemies</i>, <i>might serve him without fear</i>, (servile,
slavish fear) <i>in holiness and righteousness all our
days</i>&mdash;this, arising from love, is the <i>service in the
spirit</i>, <i>and not in the oldness of the letter</i>&mdash;not
from a fear of death and judgment, or from the pride of the
heart, hoping to bring in God a debtor; but from the influence of
sovereign love&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&rsquo;Tis love that makes our willing feet<br />
In swift obedience move&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus we run the way of God&rsquo;s commandments, as he
enlarges the heart with the influence and full persuasion of his
love.&nbsp; This is highly commended of the Lord; hence he says,
<i>I remember thee</i>, <i>the kindness of thy youth</i>, <i>and
the love of thine espousals</i>, <i>when thou wentest after me in
a land that was not sown</i>.&nbsp; So he complains of others,
<i>that they had left their first love</i>.&nbsp; With respect to
this willingness to serve the Lord, I am sure, as I felt this
love, so I was anxious to spread the savour of it in every place;
and though entirely destitute of human learning, eloquence, and
oratory, yet the Lord went before me, opening my mouth, and
opening doors <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>in his providence for me, giving testimony to the word
of his grace; some were convinced, others comforted, some brought
into sweet liberty, some were brought out of damnable errors, and
many sweetly instructed in the grand plan of a sinner&rsquo;s
salvation; and I bless God there are many witnesses to these
things to this day.&nbsp; This incurred the displeasure of the
Devil, of the Citizens of a barren country, and those Preachers
who knew nothing of the power of God in their souls, and of
course never were the instruments of communicating it to
others.&nbsp; Though in this Work I have discerned in myself too
much a savoring of flesh and blood&mdash;a willingness to cry,
<i>a confederacy</i>, to any&mdash;and I have sorely smarted for
my folly, though I never gave up an inch of truth to please any;
yet being naturally facile, and filled with zeal, with but little
knowledge, perhaps, in many instances, I have not acted so
decidedly as I ought to have done&mdash;I hope my Lord has
forgiven me this wrong, and of the Church I must beg pardon,
while I must plead youth and inexperience&mdash;but by many
scourges, reproaches, temptations, and trials, I have been since
a little better informed, and now understand the meaning of that
singular text in the Proverbs&mdash;<i>A whip for the horse</i>,
<i>a bridle for the ass</i>, <i>and a rod for the fool&rsquo;s
back</i>.&nbsp; It is now my most sincere desire to glorify God,
to speak good of his name, to be of use to his dear people, and
to make manifest the savoriness of divine truth in every place;
<a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>but this
cannot be done, either by a minister or private believer, without
opposition.&nbsp; This leads me to the following names, which in
the experience of God&rsquo;s saints are inseparable&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Methuselah</span>, which signifies <i>the
sending forth of Death</i>&mdash;and <span
class="smcap">Lamech</span>, <i>the cutting down</i>.&nbsp;
Indeed what was death ever sent for but to cut down?&nbsp; Death
penal, temporal, spiritual, or eternal.&nbsp; It appears the
above characters were the father and grand-father of <i>Noah</i>,
and seem to be prophetic of the Flood which should destroy an
ungodly world; that at the death, or soon after the death of
<i>Methuselah</i> the Flood would break out, and cut or sweep
away the old world, which was soon accomplished.&nbsp; But, to
carry on the figure, as expressive of the Work of the Spirit, may
not these Names set forth that internal war which every
convinced, mourning, illuminated believer experiences in his own
soul?&nbsp; There is a warfare before we know our part and lot in
Jesus; and there is a perpetual one after&mdash;the one before,
is between hope and despair; the life, or salvation of the soul,
hanging in doubt for years together; but upon the accomplishment
of this warfare, through the application of pardon, and receiving
the double exchange of <i>Beauty for ashes</i>, <i>the oil of joy
for mourning</i>, <i>and the garment of praise for the spirit of
heaviness</i>, as the light of God&rsquo;s countenance and his
glory shines upon the soul&mdash;this is the sending forth of
death, to cut down <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>the old man with his deeds; and as the new man receives
and enjoys the above blessings, so the old man is put off, nor
can our weaker passions dare consent to sin, for God is
there.&nbsp; But is it not a truth in the experience of
God&rsquo;s elect, in a greater or less degree, that they are
weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breast, that they must
be conformed to their Covenant Head in suffering?&mdash;that as
our blessed Jesus, after his glorious baptism, was led into the
Wilderness, to be tempted of the Devil, so must his followers,
else what is the use of the spiritual armoury, whereon there
hangs a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men&mdash;the
very idea of conquest must, of course, imply a war; and this is
carried on between the flesh and the spirit, the old man and the
new; these are yet like the Philistines and Israelites&mdash;we
are in the field, with our spiritual David, and Goliah, the
Devil, at the head of each&mdash;army, against army&mdash;the
flesh lusteth, warreth against the spirit, the spirit warreth
against the flesh&mdash;these are contrary, the one to the other,
as light and darkness, sin and grace, God and the Devil can
be.&nbsp; He that has sent forth light to see and enjoy
God&rsquo;s salvation, sends forth death to the old man&mdash;so
the Apostle says, <i>We are dead to sin by the body of
Christ</i>; sin is not dead to us, though we die to it, through
an application of the atonement; and as we live upon it from day
to day, this leads us to long for the time when we shall get
entirely rid of it.&nbsp; But into the field of battle we are <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>led, to prove
our spiritual armour; to make use of the helmet of salvation, the
shield of faith, the breast plate of righteousness, the sword of
the Spirit, and the iron shoes of Gospel peace; all of which
centre in one word, and that is CHRIST&mdash;this is the Captain
of our salvation; he heads the train of graces, for they are all
given to us, to be exercised on Christ and his finished
salvation; and as they are exercised on him so they are a death
blow to all that oppose, both within and without, and we rejoice
in hope that as he has praised the Devil&rsquo;s head on the
cross, and in our hearts, he has dethroned him; so he will,
shortly, bruise Satan under our feet this is our prospect, nor
shall we be disappointed&mdash;our way to the kingdom is hard and
rugged, through the corruptions of the human heart and the wiles
of the Devil; he has the impudence, at times, to dispute every
inch of ground.&nbsp; We have been brought to raise up some sin
in our nature, to oppose some grace in the new man; this I find
in my own experience&mdash;and if any tried, benighted travellers
can get any comfort from my afflictions they are welcome to it;
but the true state of the case is this, <i>I find a law in my
members</i>, <i>warring against the law in my mind</i>, always
trying <i>to bring me into captivity</i> to the power of
<i>sin</i> and <i>death</i>&mdash;but I am happy at times that
Christ has engaged that <i>grace shall reign</i>, nor do I wish a
greater felicity in death than to be enabled to exclaim, <i>Grace
reigns</i>!&nbsp; Faith and Unbelief strive <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>in their
turns for the mastery&mdash;Hope and Despondency, Love and
Hatred, Joy and Sorrow, Patience and Murmuring, Resignation and
Complaints, Carnality and Spirituality&mdash;sometimes I am
really overcome by this troop; but as soon as Jesus puts fresh
strength in these graces, the enemy is routed, and I can sing,
<i>Nay</i>, <i>in all these things we are more than
conquerors</i>, <i>through him that hath loved us</i>&mdash;his
appearance cuts down all my foes; as soon as he is gone they all
come again, and vex my soul.&nbsp; As he shines upon my faith,
leads forth my love, and invigorates my hope, I die to the world,
to sin, to self, to the creature, and live only to, as I live
only upon, a precious Saviour!&nbsp; This is a little of what I
do know of the subject, but must not enlarge here, only remark,
that as this world is not our rest, nor the arm of the creature
our strength, so the blessed Sprit by this warfare, leads us to
see the vanity of the world, the emptiness of the creature, the
vast importance of a Work of Grace upon the heart, and the malice
of the Devil, the deceitfulness of our own hearts, and all this,
that we may highly prize, make much of, and find rest and
consolation only in Jesus.&nbsp; This leads us to the Name,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Noah</span>, <i>Rest</i> or
<i>Consolation</i>.&mdash;This only is to be found in Christ;
hence David said, upon the reflection of his sad troubles,
<i>Return unto thy rest</i>, <i>O my soul</i>!&mdash;the learned
say in the original it is <i>Noah</i>, <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>perhaps in allusion to the Dove, who
was sent out of the Ark, but could find no rest for the soul of
its foot, till it returned.&nbsp; So we find it, experimentally,
in all seasons of worldly-mindedness, carnality, and backsliding;
we are truly miserable, we are out of our element; we can get no
consolation, no rest, till we have a sweet, cordial reception
from our dear Lord again&mdash;the Spirit has engaged to glorify
Jesus, and he does it in presenting him in his beauty and glory
to the mind, by bringing us to enjoy him, to prize him, and keep
near him; hence the command, <i>Abide in me</i>.&nbsp; So the
blessed Spirit carrying on the Work of Faith in our minds, by
exercising it on the Person, Work, and Love of Jesus, here we
find rest; <i>we which believe do enter into rest</i>; Christ is
our rest&mdash;here we cease from legal striving, and find a
Sabath rest in Christ alone:&mdash;hence he is called <i>the
consolation of Israel</i>, and we want him, as such, all the way
to glory.&mdash;Considering the sins, the trials, the crosses,
losses, and disappointments of God&rsquo;s children, no doubt
sent on purpose to keep us near the Saviour, and that we might
make up all our happiness in him; hence he says, <i>Cease ye from
man</i>, <i>whose breath is in his nostrils</i>.&nbsp; We must
learn to cease from the best of men&mdash;God often tries his
people with his people; perhaps this made the Prophet exclaim,
<i>the best of them is a briar</i>, <i>the most upright it
sharper than a thorn edge</i>.&nbsp; How wisely has our English
poet expressed it&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>I can not on earth; &rsquo;twill pierce thee to the
heart!<br />
A broken reed at best, but oft a spear;<br />
On its sharp point Peace bleeds and Hope expires!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is designed to lead us to Jesus, as our
consolation&mdash;Christ is set before us as our rest, a resting
and a dwelling place; and if I may express a few words on this
part of the subject, I must confess that I have found, and do
find rest alone in him; in his precious Atonement I get rest from
sin&mdash;in his imputed Righteousness, I cease from legal
striving and rest alone on it&mdash;in the witness of the Spirit
I find rest from doubts, fears, and the accusations of Satan, and
a quickened conscience&mdash;in point of felicity, I feel rest in
the eternity of his love, the unalterableness of his covenant,
the immutability of his nature, decrees, and purposes; and
although that declaration made me tremble in my first setting
out, I rejoice in it now&mdash;he is in one mind and none can
turn him; this is our mercy and our rest; this is what Satan, by
the instrumentality of false preachers, labours to
destroy&mdash;but if the foundation be removed, what can the
righteous do?&nbsp; This warfare, and the consolation we find in
Jesus, proves to us our Adoption; <i>as this is a path no fowl
knoweth</i>, <i>and the Vulture&rsquo;s eye hath not seen</i>,
so, on the contrary, the blessed Spirit leads his people into
this path&mdash;a way of holiness, and an highway.&nbsp; This
leading, teaching, and witnessing, evidences we have a place in
his heart, in his covenant, in his house, and that we <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>belong to
God&mdash;hence the Apostle says, <i>As many as are led by the
Spirit of God they are the Sons of God</i>.&nbsp; This naturally
leads me to the 11th Name,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Shem</span>.&nbsp; This word signifies a
<i>Name</i> or <i>Renown</i>.&nbsp; Are not God&rsquo;s children
renowned&mdash;some for faith, others for love, for wisdom, for
devotedness, and above all, for objects of eternal discriminating
grace?&nbsp; Has not our dear Lord given them a name, even that
of Sons and Daughters&mdash;of Children&mdash;of Beloved&mdash;of
a Spouse?&mdash;and, to shew our Union to Christ, were not the
Disciples first called Christians at Antioch?&nbsp; And no one
has a just right to this name who has not received the Spirit of
Christ;&mdash;hence, it was long before prophesied that they
should be called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord
should name.&nbsp; So when God makes our eternal election
manifest, he says, <i>I know thee by name</i>.&nbsp; He knew our
persons, and what names we should be called by, even literally,
before the world was made; and appointed all the circumstances
which should bring about our birth and name; and this he does in
a very singular way, to many of his people, to shew we are
preserved in Christ Jesus, until called.&nbsp; Perhaps many in
infancy and youth, have met with great pain, poverty, want, and
cruelty, from parents, friends, and guardians; others have been
in deaths oft, yet could not be destroyed, for of such was the
kingdom of God to be composed; others have been forsaken <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>of parents
entirely, they have forgot their sucking children, and left them
to perish in helpless infancy, either through want, shame, or
cruelty.&nbsp; I, myself, was so left, forsaken by parents and
friends, if report be true; and according to my name I was left
in a Church, as it is usual to name Foundlings where they are
found.&nbsp; This was really the case with my brother, Moses, who
was found in the bulrushes by Pharoah&rsquo;s daughter, and she
called him Moses, (<i>drawn out of the water</i>) because she
took him out of the water.&nbsp; Yes, my parents, whoever they
were, forsook me in infancy, and left me, probably, to
perish!</p>
<blockquote><p>Left on the world&rsquo;s bleak waste, forlorn,<br
/>
In sin conceiv&rsquo;d, to sorrow born;<br />
No guide the devious maze to tread,<br />
Above no friendly shelter spread.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But,</p>
<blockquote><p>When parents, deaf to nature&rsquo;s voice,<br />
Their helpless charge forsook;<br />
Then, nature&rsquo;s God, who heard my cries,<br />
Compassion on me took.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus I can testify to the truth of the Prophet, <i>In thee the
fatherless findeth mercy</i>; for <i>when my father and my mother
forsook me</i>, <i>then the Lord took me up</i>, and gave me the
name he had appointed me from eternity.&mdash;This is our
mercy&mdash;adopted into his family as his Sons and his
Daughters, he has given a name, <i>Ye shall be called the
children of God</i>&mdash;and to be favored with the witness of
our <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>adoption in the soul, is an unspeakable blessing indeed;
every sweet view of this privilege is calculated to warm the
heart, animate the mind, fill it with holy fervour, inflame the
affection, and fill it with burning zeal.&nbsp; This is included
in the 12th Name,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ham</span>, which signifies <i>Warmth</i>
or <i>Heat</i>.&nbsp; This, in one sense, distinguishes the mere
nominal professor and the real professor; one may have some
light, be in the judgment clear, and like a frosty night, clear,
but very cold; but God has promised to his children these two
should go together&mdash;<i>a spirit of judgment and a spirit of
burning</i>.&nbsp; When we are favored with peculiar seasons of
holy familiarity with God our covenant Father, when divine love
is shed abroad, and flows out to Jesus, in sweet
return&mdash;when we meet with a brother in Christ, and he gives
a sweet account of the Lord&rsquo;s gracious dealings with
him&mdash;when we are particularly blest under the word, or
impressed with grand and precious ideas of Jesus, these things
kindle a holy flame in the spirit.&nbsp; Or when we fall in
company with the enemies to Jesus, to the Father or the Spirit,
or to any of the leading Doctrines of the Gospel, we may be
silent a little, while musing on their errors, boldness, and
effrontery; but while we are silent his word is as a fire shut up
in our bones; we are weary with forbearing, and at last, speak we
must; the fire of holy zeal is kindled in the <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>heart, and
though we can say but little, yet we must plead for our
master&rsquo;s honour, his perfection, and his saints.&nbsp; This
zeal is discovered, at times, by the enemies of truth, and by
them called Bigotry, or a bad spirit.&nbsp; But holy zeal is
tempered with love to God and truth, and springing from a real
spiritual knowledge, can never be a bad spirit.&mdash;The many
storms a child of God meets with from Satan, the world, a body of
sin and death, persecution, and infirmities, these wean him from
the world, while the love of God sweetly operating upon his mind,
he longs to be dissolved and be with Christ, which is far better
for him.&nbsp; His soul feels at times like a bird in a cage; it
beats its pinions, and longs for enlargements.&nbsp; This leads
me to the last name,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Japheth</span>&mdash;this signifies
<i>Enlargement</i>.&nbsp; Hence the Promise and Prophecy, <i>God
shall enlarge Japheth</i>, <i>and he shall dwell in the tents of
Shem</i>.&nbsp; This is a sweet hint dropped of the salvation of
the Gentiles, and a gracious promise of a
Saviour&mdash;<i>he</i>, (that is) <i>God</i>, shall dwell in the
tents of Shem.&mdash;This was verified when the word was made
flesh and dwelt among us, and when the Gentiles were fellow heirs
with the believing Jews, in a Gospel Church State.&nbsp; This
name was figurative of that enlargement the souls of God&rsquo;s
dear people experience in life, and in the article of death, when
the spirit is freed from its cumberance.&nbsp; Perhaps the
greatest part of a believer&rsquo;s life is in a state of
bondage; <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>this comes from various quarters, and on many accounts;
this makes him sigh, for in this we groan being burdened; and
feeling this we exclaim, <i>Bring my soul out of prison</i>,
<i>that I may praise thy name</i>.&nbsp; While the Gospel is a
proclamation of liberty to the captive, the holy Spirit brings
that enlargement to the mind; and every child of God is sensible
when he is in liberty and when in bondage&mdash;when shut up and
when at large.&nbsp; Perhaps the frequent enlargements with which
we are favored, are the earnests of our entire discharge from
earth to heaven.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis blessed to notice these
enlargements in our own experience, and compare them with what
the saints of old have experienced; the Apostle Paul knew these
things, and at one time speaks of being straitened&mdash;at
another he says, Our mouth is opened unto you, our heart is
enlarged.&nbsp; I must confess I am glad these were the feelings
of an Apostle, as I have felt them so frequently&mdash;in many
sermons, alas, how I have been shut up&mdash;often in
prayer&mdash;in the company of God&rsquo;s people, and in the
presence of his adversaries.&nbsp; At other times I have felt
sweet liberty in speaking of the glory of God&rsquo;s kingdom,
and talking of his power.&nbsp; So, also, in the defence of
truth, God has given me a mouth and wisdom, that no adversary
could gainsay or resist.&nbsp; The first enlargement I found was
when God led my mind to Jesus, as my Surety, Advocate, Ransom,
Righteousness, and Remedy.&nbsp; When he shed abroad his love, I
lost <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>that
kind of fear that tormented me, and I could say, <i>O thou whom
my soul loveth</i>&mdash;and in sweet confidence&mdash;he loved
me; my mouth was enlarged to pray, to praise, and bless my
God&mdash;his ways were pleasantness, and his paths peace, and I
could run the way of his commandments, while his love enlarged my
heart&mdash;though many things have too often occurred to bring
me into bondage again, which has raised the cry in my soul,
<i>Restore unto me the joys of thy salvation</i>&mdash;and the
piteous moan of one of old, <i>He hath fenced up my way that I
cannot pass</i>, <i>and he hath set darkness in my paths</i>;
while I sensibly, at times, felt a backwardness to all that was
good&mdash;no pleasure in the Bible&mdash;reluctantly going to a
throne of grace&mdash;fit for no company&mdash;ordinances very
dry to me&mdash;my love cold, hope low, faith weak, and every
thing God did, my heart fretted against him for it, so that I was
ready to cry out to all the people of God I was acquainted
with&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Ye that love the Lord, indeed,<br />
Tell me&mdash;is it so with you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus I generally remained till the application of a
promise&mdash;one sweet word under a sermon&mdash;or a part of an
hymn&mdash;or opening the mind to plead the promises at a throne
of grace&mdash;or a sweet ray of light let in upon the mind, that
led me to review the way I was led&mdash;this brought enlargement
again&mdash;the above I have experienced many times.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>this makes our life a warfare; while our inbred sins
gaining the ascendancy, brings the mind into sad
bondage&mdash;this even works for our good, leads us to hate
self, see the malice of Satan, the need of divine keeping, and
constrains us from necessity to pray, <i>Hold thou me up and I
shall be safe</i>.&nbsp; This warfare must be accomplished, this
combat must have an end, the sooner the better; our happy release
must come, we must soon be put in possession of that glory which
we are favored with the earnest of, even eternal light, life, and
love.&nbsp; Feeling, knowing, and enjoying these things, we shall
have the glorious fruition of them by and by; the way to it is
painful, and much dreaded by the best of men, but God has always
been better to them than their fears, they have been made willing
to go; nature has shuddered, but faith has gained the victory;
their fears and unbelief has often suggested, <i>Who shall roll
away the stone from the door</i>?&mdash;but lo, the angel of the
Lord descends in time, to roll it away; hence the Redeemer says,
<i>I will come again and receive you to myself</i>, <i>that where
I am ye may be also</i>.&nbsp; <i>Thou shalt come to thy grave in
full age</i>, <i>like a shock of corn</i>, <i>fully ripe</i>,
<i>that cometh in his season</i>&mdash;the wicked is driven away
in his wickedness, but the other comes to his grave, or like a
lily full blown; for, <i>My beloved</i> (says the Church) <i>has
gone down to his garden to gather lillies</i>&mdash;and as sure
as we are gathered from the world, gathered into his Church by
effectual calling, so <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>surely shall we be gathered into his
garner.&nbsp; O what an enlargement!&mdash;now safe arrives the
heavenly mariner; the battering storm, the hurricane of life, all
dies away in one eternal calm.</p>
<blockquote><p>With joy divine, and transport in his breast,<br
/>
He gains the port of everlasting rest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will be an enlargement, or freedom from sin, from all
temptations to it, from its dominion, from the commission of it,
from the very inbeing of it.&nbsp; Now shall that promise have
its accomplishment, <i>There shall be no more the Canaanite in
the house of the Lord</i>&mdash;from Satan and his temptations,
from evil men, they that offend will be gathered out of this
kingdom, from bodily afflictions; <i>the Inhabitants shall no
more say I am sick</i>&mdash;here we shall be at liberty, enjoy
Father, Son, and Spirit; hold fellowship with him without
interruption, be favored with clear apprehensions of his
perfections and glory, as they shine in Christ.&nbsp; Then we
shall see, love, admire, and adore the Lamb in the midst of the
throne&mdash;see the glory of his person, with the eyes of the
soul, and his body with our bodily eyes&mdash;the glory of his
human nature: see him in that nature that bore our sins, wearing
the very marks and scars he received for us; that dear head that
was once crowned with thorns! that dear face that was once marred
more than any! those dear hands, feet, and side, that were
wounded!&nbsp; We shall then see him in all his
glory&mdash;<i>This is the joy set before us</i>, <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>for which we
endure the cross; we shall see him as he is, and be like him for
ever&mdash;<i>This is the glory to be revealed in the saints</i>,
beyond all comparison; this will be a joy unspeakable, and full
of glory.&nbsp; How sweet the promise, <i>The ransomed of the
Lord shall return</i>, <i>and come to Zion with songs</i>, <i>and
everlasting joy upon their heads</i>; <i>they shall obtain joy
and gladness</i>, <i>and sorrow and sighing shall flee
away</i>!&nbsp; This shall be the high priviledge of every vessel
of mercy.</p>
<p>I close this Sermon with an excellent quotation from Mr.
<i>Huntington&rsquo;s</i> &ldquo;Spiritual Sea Voyage;&rdquo;
which book has often entertained me.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Free grace and her crew
all arrived at last,<br />
No sailor was miss&rsquo;d, when the muster was past;<br />
By thousands and millions the angels appear&rsquo;d,<br />
And welcomed us with the anthems we heard.<br />
We sung of Redemption, in Jesus the Lord&mdash;<br />
Of sovereign Love, and how we were restor&rsquo;d&mdash;<br />
The dangers we met, and the helps that appear&rsquo;d&mdash;<br
/>
Of infinite Wisdom, by which we were steer&rsquo;d.<br />
Delightful the Union, and great was the throng,<br />
The melody charming, delightful the song:<br />
An order came forth for ascending the throne,<br />
And when we were seated the judgment came on.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, christian reader, I have shewn my opinion of the
<i>Names of the Patriarchs</i>.&nbsp; I have not written all I
wished, lest it should swell this Sermon to a volume.&nbsp; I
have noticed some of the Lord&rsquo;s dealings with my own
soul&mdash;every minister ought to give some account of a Work of
Grace upon his <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>own heart; I have not made myself all in all, rather
nothing at all; I only aimed at the exaltation of that grace it
is God&rsquo;s delight to display.&nbsp; I have chosen this
method of sending it into the world, because, as I went over
these Names, various parts of my own experience appeared so clear
I could not forbear mentioning them, to the honour of God.&nbsp;
I originally intended to publish an Account of the Dealings of
the Lord with me, in a Series of Letters, when I could have been
more explicit and regular in my Narrative; but as I intend those
Letters, only for a few thoughts on some interesting passages of
Scripture, I have made mention of the above in this Sermon; this
will no doubt procure me much more opposition from friend and
foe; however, what I have written is the truth; to the God of all
truth I commit it, hoping it will be blessed to the friends of
truth&mdash;remembering divine Love, or Charity, rejoiceth not in
iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, hopeth
all things, <i>endureth all things</i>.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
